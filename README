Multiplayer HTML5 King of the Hill

Server manages position and facing of each player.

The game starts when 2 clients connect.
When additional client connects, server sends game state. Server sends updates
to each client whenever client connects, leaves, or makes action. Server and
client maintain whole game state. Periodically send entire state to all clients.

## Client -> Server
There are only two game related events that client can send to server - move
and spin. In addition, client can send join which includes a player name:

### join
{
  'name': 'Joey'
}

## Server -> Client

Server forwards client events to other clients, so sends the same move, spin,
and join events, with playerId attached to all of them.

In addition, server sends whole state of game

### state

{
  'players': {
    1: {
      'name': 'Joey',
      'x': 20,
      'y': 25,
      'angle': 70,
      'score': 100,
      'mode': 'move'|'spin'
    }, ...
  }
  'king': 1
}
